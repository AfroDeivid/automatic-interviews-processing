Do you sometimes feel that this is the person, this presence trying to interact with you, communicate with you? Not really, because they still talk to each other, but very slowly. The gentleman in grey? Yes, but he talks to the others who are with this grey gentleman. I see him, I see him every night, but in principle he is alone. He’s all alone. Okay. So, he’s not trying to talk to you? No. Do you feel like he’s trying to read your mind or that he already knows what you’re thinking? I don’t know. Sometimes I wonder, do they already know what’s going to happen tomorrow? Does that mean? Yes, because. How do you explain it? As if he knew what was going to happen tomorrow. Who could predict what was going to happen? Yes, something like that? Predict? Yes, or maybe he does a calculation. A calculation to know an average? I don’t know what to say. Well, I don’t know. Maybe I am saying something lousy. No, but you say what you think. So how do you explain this phenomenon? With the old man? Yes. Well, I guess. Why is this happening to you? What do you think? Yes, that’s a good question. I don’t know. I don’t know what they’re trying to say. Never had the courage to ask them. Because there is a friend who asked me: Do you know what they want to do at your place? You ask, why are you here? But I’m a little scared. What scares you, to ask? to ask questions? To ask this question? I don’t know. The answer may be. Do you think it is real, actually? No, I don’t think it’s real because it’s not very sophisticated. For example, the girls with the tubes who wanted to cut my hair, these are tubes that were used in laboratories in 1965 or something like this, big like this, made of glass. I think if it were real, it would have been much more modern. But you still believe it, when it happens to you. Because, the urge to ask questions of the gentleman in grey, the urge to ask: What do you want? What is happening? Yes, I would like it to stop, because I would like to be quiet at home again, etc. But do you think that by asking questions, you will get answers? I don’t know. I may not have the courage to ask. Okay. Maybe if I wasn’t alone. Usually, I’m alone. Maybe if it wasn’t, then I would pull him by the hands. And then I would say, listen, what do you want? Or do you speak? Or you can get the hell out of here, this is my apartment, I pay the rent, that’s it and I am the boss. Okay, ok. I think I would have already told him to clean up. If I thought it was true. Now, we’re going to go back to the beginning. So there was this gentleman in grey recently, over the last four weeks. But before that, there were the two girls and the two men. So, same thing, in terms of duration, how long do these presences last? So there are four people at the same time. You feel the presence of four people at the same time? They came the same day. I will say the same night. Then, they all left at the same time, both. How long did they last each time they were there? I didn’t want to have my hair cut by this one. So, I think I struggled to avoid having my hair cut. But one night I decided to pretend to sleep and watch what was going to happen. Suddenly, I heard a scissor sound. Tchac So you think they could have cut your hair? Yes, but I didn’t see the hair that had just been cut, it was like before. Your hair was quite normal? Yes, but then it was good. They left.

      "Reference: So it happened? Yes, I had to think about it. I took several days before getting my hair cut. The possibility that it was for a new haircut is excluded. I think they wanted my hair to do some research on my DNA and that we would do some research on it. Both boys and girls were a team of biologists. So, from the first time these characters appeared, until you had this thought that they wanted to cut your hair. How long did it take? Maybe three nights or four days. So, the first time, when it happened to you. You didn’t think about what they wanted? No, not the first time. Three nights later, did you think about that when they were already there, present or was it during the day when there were no characters? No. Oh, that was during the day. Those people I think. I don’t remember... Understood. But, maybe more towards the evening, because it always happened towards the evening. Okay, so always around 9 p.m. So it was just before they arrived that you thought about why they were coming? Yeah, yeah. Okay, where were these characters, the four of them when they arrived, always behind? Always behind. Never left or right? No, always behind. Left again not because it was the couch. There the couch was being used by me. They couldn’t. So there was no? There was no room. So right, a little bit. These are characters you’re familiar with? No, not either. But I thought it might be someone professional. But I didn’t find an answer there. Okay, very good.\n",
      "Hypothesis: So it happened? Yes, I still had to think about it. I took several days before I had my hair cut. The possibility that it was for a new haircut is ruled out. I think they wanted my hair to do research on my DNA and to do research on it. The two boys and the two girls were a team of biologists. So, from the first time these characters appeared, until the moment you had this thought that they wanted to cut your hair. Maybe three nights or four days. So the first time this happened to you, you didn't think about what they wanted? No, not the first time. Three nights later, did you think about it when they were already there, present or was it during the day when there were no characters? No. Ah, that was during the day. Those people, I think. I don't remember... It's all right. But, maybe it was towards the evening, because it always happened towards the evening. Okay, so it was always around 9:00 p.m. So it was just before they arrived that you thought about it and thought about why they were coming? Oh, yeah. Okay, where were these characters, the four of them, when they arrived, still behind? Still behind. Never left or right? No, always behind. To the left, again not because it was the couch. There it was occupied by me. They couldn't. So there was no? There was no room. So on the right, a little bit. Are these characters familiar to you? No, neither. But, I thought maybe it's someone professional. But I didn't find an answer there. Okay, very good.\n",

      "Reference: So the first question I'm going to ask you is, do you ever feel someone or something, for example a shadow or feel someone or something pass by your side sides like that, quite briefly. Have you felt this way in the last four weeks? Something moving, you say? Something happening on the sides? Yes, when I ride a bike. But am I going to mix with, which is totally normal, when we create a shadow. But a lot of times, I imagine that there is someone next to me when I ride my bike and I will even speed up to lose him and then he is always there, because he is my shadow I think. So that's something different again. But if you look back a little bit at the experiences you've had over the past month in the last four weeks, did you, while riding a bike or doing very little, feel that something was going to the sides, to your sides, like that? What I just told you. Is that right? And then, when I'm in bed, I sometimes have the impression, since I have other colors, that I have the impression that I live with someone by my side on one side. Okay, so that's another question Another one? So no, I don't think so. So you don't feel like you have something going on? Is there movement on the side? No, no, not something that passes. So then, second question, does it happen to you or has it happened to you, always in the last four weeks, to have the impression of feeling the presence of someone or something next to or behind you? When in reality, there is no one there. That's kind of what I just told you when I'm in bed. Sometimes I feel like I'm not alone. Okay. And I see two tasks next to me and I really have to come back to myself to see that there's no one there. Okay. And does that happen to you? In the last month, was it rarely, at least once a month or occasionally, several times, Several times. Or frequently, several times a week? Yes. And daily, every day? Almost every day. Almost every day. All right. I create a character for myself. I have to come back to myself to see that there is no one there. But are you awake when it happens to you in bed, or are you asleep? I play, I watch TV, I'm all alone. I don't know if it’s something that I notice is something next to me and it gives me a certain tranquility, a certain tranquility. Okay, I understand very well. So in relation to that, do you have the impression that this phenomenon, of feeling someone next to you, does it have an impact on your life, on your day-to-day functioning? Do you feel worried or emotionally distressed? No. I think it's normal for me to live like this. Okay. So, for you, it's not something very serious that happens? No. It's something that accompanies my loneliness. But no, I even appreciate it! Okay. So it's something that you feel strongly, is it persistent? I feel like I'm not alone. Okay, we'll come back to that a little bit later, I'll ask you more about that. We'll keep it for a little bit later. I am going to ask you another question. Still in the last four weeks. So, remember that all the questions I am going to ask you concern the month that has just passed. Have you ever seen something else instead of a real object, for example? Seeing an animal instead of a bush or a spot on the ground that turns into an insect or other things that take on another form? Yes, commonly, but it's been more than four months, now more. Otherwise, before, it was common, and I often saw female people while I was running, so I see a person 50 meters away. Okay, and I see almost with details and people who move when I pass by. When I came to realize that I was continuing further, she always stayed in her place. But I see her making this movement. And often it happened to me. I'm telling you, I spent a month or two, where I was doing well, because there were only beautiful things that I saw. Okay. But in the last four weeks, there hasn't been that, right? No. OK. Can I tell you something? Maybe it can help you. Tell me. When I'm in bed, I wake up at night because of noises, I see in front of me, the exit door and I see, for example, on a window pane, this blue line that you see here, I see it moving, I see it going up. And I always have the impression that there is a person who is there, who passes in front of the door of my premises. And then, when I come next to it, to look, everything is in order, nothing moves. But I look at the tiles on the floor, I see a corner of the tile with a black spot. I see this task moving forward on the tile line. Okay, I'll take note, we'll come back to that. This is the case. So tell me before you were diagnosed with Parkinson's, did you have this kind of symptoms, this kind of phenomenon, everything that we talked about there? No, no. Okay, now we're going to see other types of hallucinations. Also, during the last 4 weeks, have you ever seen people, animals, objects or scenes that did not exist, that others did not see, that is to say, you clearly see things that are not real? Yes, I have already told you the story of the dwarf I saw in the city of Zion. That was 4 weeks ago? No, it's been more than four weeks. It's been more than four weeks. And during the last four weeks? In the last four weeks, I don't see characters anymore. Do you ever see anything other than characters? What I see now is maybe television. When I was watching television where the character I'm watching isn't the one who's really on television, I can't seem to... I don't know how to put it. I don't draw... I don't see the drawing of a face directly. I have to look it up on the TV. Then this person comes along, but it takes a while, it's hard to explain. You pass by, I watch you on television, I don't see you, but another character who deforms. And to see you, I almost have to concentrate and look for that person. I can't express myself... Okay. So you see faces that are a little ambiguous, a little, that distorts because you watch TV? That's it. That's right. And that happens to you on a daily basis, almost every day, or rather...? Less now. But maybe a month ago something like that. Is it frequent, when several times a week? It was frequent. And then it bothered me because... I have to look for the person on the TV, it's not normal. So, it was several times a week, right? Yes, count a few times a week, multiple times, I feel like it's too much. So, occasionally? Yes, occasionally. And so it was quite strong and persistent or was it very brief? When I watch TV before I can see the character talking on TV, it's goes on for a little while. And then I have a click, and then the image is sharp. Okay. That's what I see, yes. And what I see a lot. Maybe it can help you. Do you see any iron framework on a slab? His irons like that? Or tiles and tiling, tiles. I see two lines of tiling and when I'm walking it feels like, I'm walking under the line of tiles. I almost stop, I don't dare to continue. Okay, you get the impression that the lines are going to...? I see double line and I feel like I'm going under the first layer with my foot. Do you have the impression that your body, your foot, goes underneath? Below the Tile Line And that the tiles also warp? The tiles go up or side like that. Okay, okay. And so, to come back to the question I asked you, do you see objects, people, animals or shapes that other people don't see? I don't think so. What I see: I'm on the road, there's one person coming, I see two people. The one behind is always bigger than the one in front, and when I get to the moment of crossing with her, there is only one left that is at its normal size. Okay, so these are real things that exist but that you see in duplicate? Oui. Do you ever hear sounds, music, noises, or voices that other people don't hear and don't exist? Non. Auditory hallucinations? Non. In the same way, have you ever smelled, always in the last 4 weeks, smells that can be pleasant, unpleasant, when there is nothing around you that allows you to smell the smell? Non Okay, so no olfactory hallucinations. Have you ever had, always in the last four weeks, an unpleasant or pleasant taste in your mouth, when there is nothing you have put in your mouth, for no apparent reason? Do you feel any tastes? No. There is one thing that I realized that you asked me the question. I feel like I'm making liquids, when I'm in bed, when I'm sleeping. Regarding salivation, drooling? And now, in the morning, there's liquid running down my lips. Yes, it can happen, indeed. Another question still during the last 4 weeks, have you ever felt something or that someone touched you on the skin, for example? It can also be itching or burning, tingling, warm, cold on the skin or on other parts of your body, but for no apparent reason, without anyone there. I always have a lot of tingling in the tips of my toes and fingers. Yes, and it's awful sometimes. And I feel like with the medication I've been given, it's Dr. Wicki, if I don't have burns of my toes and hands, I'm fine. On the other hand, if I have these burns, I'm in  bad state. When I had burns, how can I express myself... I have extremities that burn me. It works in my head all day long. I'm not well because it hurts, but the opposite, if I don't have a burn, I'm knocked out. Okay, so that happens to you when you're taking your medication? When I take it now. But I take them regularly. Okay, fine. But you didn't feel people touching you, sensations of touching on the skin? Or parts of your body that change, that move? No. For example, feeling that there are things moving inside your body or feeling threads or pieces of skin around your fingers, that kind of sensation? No. Okay. And before Parkinson's disease, did you have this kind of phenomenon of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations etc...? No, but I already had tinnitus. Okay. Another question, still during the last four weeks. Have you ever had the impression that people you know, or strangers, are present in your house, in your home or live in your home without you being able to see or hear them? No, no problem In other words, you feel their presence in your home, but you feel them in other rooms, not necessarily next to you, but without you being able to see or hear them. No, never problems on that side. Even before the last 4 weeks, you never had this? No. And before Parkinson's either? No. Another question now about ideas or beliefs that we may have so we are convinced of something. You tell me, if it concerns you, if it happens. During the last four weeks, have you ever had ideas or beliefs such as thinking that someone wants to hurt you, wants to rob you or that someone is following you in the street, that you are being persecuted, have you had these kinds of ideas? No, never. Did you feel or have you had the idea that your friend or spouse is cheating on you, trying to cheat on you, and that you need to look for evidence of his or her infidelity? No, I don't have any friends, I'm alone. Have you had any ideas or beliefs that your body and mind are controlled by outside forces or people? As if you had the impression that everything you do did not come from you, was imposed on you, for example your thoughts, your actions are not yours? No, quite normally. So, have you ever believed or thought that people you know have been replaced by perfectly identical people, who are in fact impostors? No. If there are any questions that you don't understand, that I need to repeat, please don't hesitate to tell me. Have you ever thought or written, believed that people you know are capable of disguising themselves or changing their appearance in order to influence you? No, no. Have you ever had any ideas or thoughts that where you are now has been duplicated and it's in another city or country? No. Have you thought, always in the last four weeks, that others, for example your loved ones, have been changed or transformed into other people, both on the physical level, on the level of their body, but also on the level of their mental, psychological level? No, never. Did you have any thoughts or beliefs that you had a double who is living his own life somewhere else? This double would be another version of yourself, but one that has its own life elsewhere. No. So, have you ever thought or believed that you were dead, that you no longer exist, or that you lost your organs, body parts, or blood? No. So, before Parkinson's disease, did you ever have these kinds of thoughts or beliefs? No. Okay. Another series of questions, still during the last four weeks, which have just passed, have you ever seen yourself in front of you as in a mirror or seen your body next to you with sometimes the impression that you have come out of your body? You know what I mean? Yes, I understand.  No, I never had. You've never had that? No, not on that side. Have you ever seen yourself outside of your own body? For example, you are lying down and you see yourself from the ceiling as if you have left your body and you can see from above. No, never. And before Parkinson's disease, did you ever experience this phenomenon? No. So now I'm going to ask you one more series of questions, always a little weird, a little strange, that you may have experienced in the last 4 weeks. So, we're always going to stay in the last four weeks and you're going to tell me if it happened to you or not, and how often it happened to you, and how severe it was, okay? Yes. So there are some questions that will, that are going to be similar to the ones that I've already asked you before. So, if there are things that you have already answered, I will stop to put the answer without asking you a second time. There are other questions that are a little similar, but I will ask you them anyway to make sure that we have properly evaluated them. So you told me that you never had auditory hallucinations, that is, you never heard a voice, noises or other sounds that others didn't hear, that didn't exist. It can be female and male voices, voices of all kinds? No. So, still at the level of auditory hallucinations, the question is a little different: have you ever heard voices commenting on what you were doing or what you thought? No. That is to say, you are thinking something, you are doing something and you hear voices commenting on what you are doing. No, never. Have you ever heard two or more voices talking to each other? No. So you told me before that you don't have a strange feeling inside your body. Like your body makes you feel like it's changing size or limbs, parts of your body that are changing size or shape? No. Have you had any problems in your relationships with other people? Do you feel like other people are against you or are going to hurt you? Or are people plotting against you? No, I don't know anyone. I didn't have any problems. Okay. So I'm already checking off the answers you had given to me before. So did you feel like you had committed something serious, terrible, for which you should be punished? No. You don't feel guilty, even though you've sinned and you need to be punished? No. So sometimes we can be a believer and a religious. I don't know if that's the case for you? Yes, a little bit. I'm a bit of a believer. Sometimes some people may also have experiences with their faith and religion, have you ever had unusual religious experiences? No. I have been contacted sometimes with people who have given me a little theory and I had been asked to pray with them. Then I played along, but it's a bit of a recreation. Okay, you don't have thoughts such as you're an envoy of God or a god or you're possessed or you have mystical experiences? No, not at all. I told you once, about what I felt, it was on the side of my head. There were fires on August 1st, which went off or firecrackers, stars, and it was at the exit of a store. I don't know why I saw stuff like that. And then I almost fell on the ground and I thought I was going to die, that somewhere, my brain was exploding in 2 or I don't know, that's the only time I felt something weird. In your head? In my head, I was fine and I said to myself, I'm fine to die. It had a weird effect on my head, on the back left of my head. Okay. And has that happened to you in the last four years? It happened to me a little over four weeks ago. Okay, so it feels like your head was on fire. What was that? I feel like stars were coming out of a volcano on the back of my head. And I felt that it was moving, something was leaving. And then everything went well. After that, it was over. And then it made me funny. Okay so, that's kind of what I asked you actually, if you had the impression that you had a little bit of strange sensations in your body, so including your head. Yes, you could say that either you have to choose: either what I felt was physical, or some kind of divine thing that came to take me away, take me, I don't know what. Are you removing something? Who was killing me so that I would disappear somewhere, but not negative, positive. So you had this impression that they wanted to kill you? I have the impression that it was moving. I have a weird feeling. Did you feel it in your body? There, only there. And then I said to myself I'm going to be knocked out, unconscious, I'm going to die and in total, it lasted, I don't know, 15-20 seconds and then it disappears. And that, you, did it happen to you only once? Yes, only once in my life. And you felt worried, anxious? No. I was scared because I said to myself, something is happening. But in short, I was fine and then nothing happened. It was 15 seconds or 30 seconds, I don't know. Okay, but when you were better than bad? Yes. And I can tell you about it, I fell on my bike when I was fifteen. And I hurt myself here (on the head). So, it's a bit weird. And so, you thought it was divine intervention? It's hard to say, there was something mystical about it. Mystical? Yes, I found that. I felt like I was dying and that everything was going to end for me. Then I was going somewhere. Okay. I thought about that. I remember that very well. Am I going to die or not? Did I feel weird? Okay. And those stars that I saw twinkling, just to say it, it's weird. Okay, I'll write it down. But did you think at that moment that you had a problem with your body? No. That your brain is liquefying...? I had like not a friend, but a person I knew well next to me. I don't know if there was a lady, I wasn't alone and that's when I saw this phenomenon that lasted between 15 and 30 seconds, I don't know, but I was leaving my place instead. I was taking off like a rocket, not a rocket, like a flying saucer. Then I thought it was going on, then that I was going to die, splash. And then I didn't die and it didn't continue. Okay. You said it lasted, only a few seconds, didn't you? It lasted a few seconds, but I felt funny. I thought I was going to die, but no pain and I was fine. Have you ever walked into a room and thought people were talking about you and laughing at you? Recently, in the last four weeks? No, not like that. Or have you seen things in magazines or on television that seemed to concern you as if the message was especially for you? No. So, during the last four weeks, have you felt that you are being controlled by an outside force? That you were for example an agent of God or an external force, such as an alien or a machine. No. That you were for example an agent of God or an external force, such as an alien or a machine, that you were being forced to do things? No. Have you ever had the feeling, always in the last four weeks, that others could read your thoughts, that is, that your thoughts could be heard and known by others? No? Or have you ever heard your thoughts said out loud as if they were spoken outside your head, that they could be broadcast outside your head? No. Have you ever felt that an external force was inside you head, thoughts? No. For example, you find yourself with an idea, a thought in your head, but you didn't think it? There's someone who put things in you. No, a bit like a devil's thought? For example, or something other than external forces. External forces? No, I've never had that problem. Have you ever felt or thought that your own ideas and thoughts have been stolen by an outside force? Things were taken from your head? You, how do you say...  Possessed by the devil? Not necessarily. In this case, for example, someone or something takes your thoughts. Do you find yourself empty in your head without thoughts? No, not at all. Another question: have you ever been remarked, remarked, or do you think that there is something strange in your presentation, in the way you dress, in the way you present yourself? Has anyone made any remarks of this kind? No one ever made a remark, but I may have often thought that I was being laughed at, but maybe because I wasn't like the others. But no one has ever made any remarks to me. Insofar as I tell myself a little bit that escapes me today, that I don't know how to put it... That I am different from others, help me. Are you different from the others? Do you think you're different from others? Yes, sometimes and I think I have a little different attitude from others. In your personality? In my personality, yes. So, you've always been ? I think I'm an outsider. Okay, but you've always thought you're someone like that? I think I'm an outsider, but how can I put it... But it's good. Okay. So sometimes, we can tend to behave in an inappropriate way in relation to society or towards others, guided by ourselves, by impulses that we cannot control. For example, have you ever done things that people consider weird or that have caught the attention of others? For example, masturbating in public, urinating in public, or behaving inappropriately in front of others? No, no, on that side, I think I'm totally normal. No, I never had that obsession. Have you ever tried to hurt someone or animals in the last four weeks, that you have this desire, this impulse that pushes you to get angry with someone? No. Are there also things that you do and redo all the time, repetitively, that you can't stop doing? For example, eating, putting things away, wanting to do the same thing all the time, doing the same things without being able to stop. No, no, no problem. Or for example arrange things in a well-defined order? If you can't do it or if something interrupts you, you have to start all over again to be able to do things No, I'm not a maniac, either. Understood.\n",
      "Hypothesis: So the first question I'm going to ask you is, have you ever felt someone or something, like a shadow or felt someone or something go over the sides like this, in a fairly brief way? Something that moves, you say? Something going on on the sides? Yes, when I'm riding a bike, but I'm going to mix it with, which is perfectly normal, when we're creating a shadow, but a lot of times, I imagine that there's someone next to me when I'm riding a bike, and I'm even going to accelerate to sow it, and then it's still there, because it's my shadow, I think. So this is still something different, but if you go back a little bit to the experiences that you've had in the last month, in the last four weeks, is it that, while riding a bike or doing not much, you felt that something was happening on the sides, on your sides, like this? What I just told you. Is that it, actually? And then, when I'm in bed, I sometimes feel, since I have other colors, I feel like I'm living with someone on one side of me. Okay, that's another question. Another one? Well, no, I dont think so. So you don't feel like there's something going on? No, no, not something that happens. So, second question, do you ever, or have you ever, in the last four weeks, had the impression that you felt the presence of someone or something next to you or behind you, when in reality, there was no one there? It's kind of what I've just been telling you actually when I'm in bed. It's all right. And I see two tails next to me and I really have to come back to myself to see that there's no one there. Okay, and this, this has happened to you in the last month, was it rarely, at least once a month or occasionally, several times, Several times. Or frequently, several times a week? Yes, you did. And daily, every day? Almost every day. Almost every day. Okay. I create a character for myself, and I have to come back to myself to actually see that there's no one there. But are you awake when it happens in bed, or are you asleep? I play, I watch TV, I'm all alone, I don't know if it's something that I notice that there's something next to me and it gives me a certain quiet, a certain tranquility. Okay, so I understand very well. So in relation to that, do you feel that this phenomenon, of feeling someone next to you, does it have an impact on your life, on your day-to-day functioning? Do you feel anxious or emotionally distressed? No. I think it's normal for me to live like this. Okay. So for you, its not something very serious thats happening? No, it's something that accompanies my loneliness, but no, I even appreciate it. Okay. So its something you feel strongly about, is it persistent? I feel like I'm not alone. OK, we'll come back to that a little bit later, I'll ask you more questions about that aspect. We'll keep that for a little while later. There, I'll ask you another question. Also in the last four weeks. So remember that all the questions I'm going to ask you are about the past month. Have you ever seen something other than a real object, for example? See an animal instead of a bush or a stain on the ground that turns into an insect or other things that take on a different form? Yes, regularly, but it's been more than four months, now more. Otherwise, before, regularly, and I often saw people of the female sex as I do running, so I see a person at 50 meters. Okay, and I see to finish almost with details and people moving when I pass. When I realized that I continue further, she always stays in her place. But I see her doing this movement. And often it happened to me. I tell you, I spent a month or two or I was fine because there were beautiful things I saw. Okay. But during the last four weeks, there hasnt been that, right? No, it is not. All right, all right. Can I tell you something? Maybe it can help you. Tell me about it. When I'm in bed, I wake up at night because of noises, I see in front of me, the exit door and I see for example on a window tile, this blue line that you see here, I see it moving, I see it going up. And I always have the impression that there is a person who is there, who passes in front of the door of my local. And then, when I come next, look, there is everything in order, nothing moving. But I look at the tiles on the floor, I see a corner of the tile with a black dot. OK, I'll take note, we'll get back to that. That's the case. So tell me before your diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, did you have these kinds of symptoms, these kinds of phenomena, all of the things that we talked about there? No, not at all. OK, now we're going to look at other types of hallucinations. Also during the last four weeks, have you ever seen people, animals, objects or scenes that didn't exist, that others didn't see, that is to say clearly see things that aren't real? Yes, I already told you, the story of the dwarf I saw in the city of Zion. Was that four weeks ago? No, more than four weeks ago. Its been more than four weeks. And during the last four weeks? During the last four weeks, I can no longer see any characters. Do you ever see anything other than characters? What I see now is maybe television. When I was watching television where the character I'm watching is not the one who's really on television, I can't... I don't know how to say it. I don't draw... I can't see the drawing of a face directly. I have to look for it on TV. Then afterwards, this person comes, but it takes some time, it's hard to explain. Okay. So you see faces that are a little bit ambiguous, a little bit distorted because you're watching TV? There you go. Thats it. And that, that happens to you daily, almost every day, or rather...? Less now. But maybe a month ago something like that. Is it frequent, how many times a week? It was common, and then it bothered me because... I have to look for the person on TV, it's not normal. So it was several times a week, right? Yes, score a few times a week, several times, I feel like it's too much. So, occasionally? Yes, occasionally. And so it was quite strong and persistent or it was very brief? When I watch TV before I can see the character talking on TV, it goes on for a little while, and then I have like a click, and then the image is clear. I agree. That's what I see. And what I see a lot. Maybe it can help you. You see a piece of scrap metal on a slab? Its iron like that? Or tiles and tiles, tiles. I see two lines of tiles and I feel like when I walk, I'm walking under the tile line. I almost stop, I don't dare go on. Okay, do you feel like the lines are...? I see the line doubled and I feel like I'm putting my foot under the first layer. Do you feel like your body, your foot, is going underneath? Under the tile line And that the tiles are deforming too? The tiles go up or down like this. Okay, okay. So, back to the question I asked you, do you see objects, people, animals or shapes that other people don't see? I don't think. What I see: I'm on the road, there's a person coming, I see two people. The one behind is always bigger than the one in front, and when I get to the moment of crossing with her, there's more than one that's her normal size. Okay, so these are real things that exist but you see them in duplicate? Yes, you did. Do you ever hear sounds, music, noises, or voices that other people don't hear and don't exist? No, it is not. Hearing hallucinations? No, it is not. In the same way, has it ever happened to you, always during the last four weeks, to smell smells that can be pleasant, unpleasant, when there is nothing around you that allows you to smell? No, it is not Okay, so no olfactory hallucinations. Have you ever, in the last four weeks, had an unpleasant or pleasant taste in your mouth when there's nothing you've put in your mouth for no apparent reason? Do you feel tastes? No, there's one thing I noticed that you asked me, and it seems to me that I'm making liquid when I'm in bed when I'm sleeping. Regarding the salivation, the drooling? And now, in the morning, theres liquid running down my lips. Yes, it can happen, indeed. Another question always during the last 4 weeks, have you ever felt something or someone touching you for example on the skin? It can also be itching or burning sensations, itching, heat, cold on the skin or on other parts of your body, but without any apparent reason, without anyone being there. I'm always full of tingling at the ends of my toes and fingers. Yes, and it's awful sometimes. And I feel like with the medication they've given me, it's Dr. Wicki, if I don't have burns, toes and hands, I'm fine. On the other hand, if I have these burns, I'm in pain. When I have burns, how do I express myself... I have burns in my extremities that work in my head all day long. Okay, so, does that happen when you take your medication? When I take them now. But I take them regularly. Okay, fine, but didn't you feel people touching you, sensations of touching your skin, or parts of your body changing, moving? No, it is not. Like feeling things moving inside your body or feeling threads or pieces of skin around your fingers, that kind of feeling? No, it is not. And before Parkinson's disease, did you have this kind of phenomenon of auditory, visual hallucinations and so on? No, but I already had tinnitus. Okay, another question, still in the last four weeks, has it ever happened to you that you feel that people you know, or strangers, are present in your house, in your home, or live in your home without you being able to see or hear them? No, not a problem. In other words, you feel their presence in your home, but you feel them in other rooms, not necessarily next to you, but without being able to see or hear them. No problems on that side. Even before the last four weeks, you never had this? No, it is not. And before Parkinsons disease, too? No, it is not. Another question now about ideas or beliefs that we can have so we are convinced of something you tell me if it concerns you, if it happens during the last four weeks have you ever had ideas or beliefs such as thinking that someone wants to hurt you, wants to steal from you or that someone is following you on the street, that you are being persecuted have you had such ideas? No, not ever. Have you ever had the impression or the idea that your friend or spouse is cheating on you, trying to cheat on you and that you should look for evidence of his or her infidelity? No, I dont have any friends, Im alone. Have you ever had ideas or beliefs that your body and your mind are controlled by outside forces or people, as if you felt that everything you do was not from you, was imposed on you, for example, your thoughts, your actions are not your own? No, it's perfectly normal. So, have you ever believed or thought that people you know have been replaced by perfectly identical people who are actually impostors? No, it is not. If there are any questions you don't understand, that I need to repeat, don't hesitate to tell me. Have you ever thought or written, believed that people you know are able to disguise themselves or change their appearance in order to influence you? No, not at all. Have you ever had ideas or thoughts that the place where you are now has been duplicated and it is in another city or another country? No, it is not. Have you ever thought, always during the last four weeks, that others, for example your loved ones, have been changed or have become other people, both physically, physically, but also mentally, psychologically? No, never did. Have you ever had thoughts or beliefs that you had a double who lives his own life somewhere else? No, it is not. So, have you ever thought or believed that you were dead, that you no longer exist, or that you had lost your organs, parts of your body or your blood? No, it is not. So, before Parkinson's disease, did you ever have these kinds of thoughts or beliefs? No, it is not. Okay, another series of questions, still during the last four weeks, which has just passed, is what happened to you to see yourself in front of you as in a mirror or to see your body next to you with sometimes the impression that you have come out of your body? Yes, I understand. No, I have never had one. You never had that? No, not this way. Have you ever seen yourself outside your own body? For example, you're lying down and you see yourself from the ceiling as if you've left your body and you see from above. No, never did. And before Parkinson's disease, have you ever experienced this phenomenon? No, it is not. So now I'm going to ask you another series of questions, still a little bit strange, a little bit strange phenomena, that you may have experienced in the last four weeks. Yes, you did. So there are some questions that are going to be similar to the ones that I've already asked you before, so if there are some things that you've already answered, I'm going to stop and put the answer without asking you the question a second time. So you told me that you've never had auditory hallucinations, that is, you've never heard voices, noises or other sounds that other people didn't hear, that didn't exist. No, it is not. In the case of auditory hallucinations, the question is a little different: have you ever heard voices commenting on what you were doing or thinking? No, it is not. That is to say, you, you think something, you are doing something and you hear voices commenting on what you are doing. No, never did. Have you ever heard two or more voices talking to each other? No, it is not. So you told me before that you don't have any strange sensations inside your body, like your body is giving you the impression of changing size or limbs, parts of your body that are changing size or shape? No, it is not. Have you had problems in your relationships with other people? Do you feel that other people are against you or will hurt you? Or are people plotting against you? No, I dont know anyone. I didnt have any problems. Okay, so I'm already checking the answers you gave me before, so did you feel like you did something serious, terrible, that you should be punished for? No, it is not. Dont you feel guilty, even if you have sinned and you must be punished? No, it is not. So sometimes you can be a believer and a religious person. I don't know if that's your case? Yes, a little bit. Im a little bit of a believer. Sometimes some people can also have experiences with their faith and religion, have you ever had unusual religious experiences? No, I've been contacted a few times by people who gave me a little theory and asked me to pray with them, and then I played the game, but it's kind of a recreation. Okay, don't you have thoughts like you're an envoy of God or a god or you're possessed or you have mystical experiences? No, not at all. I told you once, what I felt was on the side of my head, there were fires on August 1st, which were either firecrackers, stars, and it was outside a store, and I don't know why I saw things like that, and then I almost fell to the ground and I thought I was going to die, that somewhere, my brain was jumping in two or I don't know, that's the only time I felt something weird. In your head? In my head, I was fine, and I thought I was fine to die, and it had a weird effect on my head, on the back of my head. Okay. And this happened to you during the last four? It happened to me a little over four weeks ago. OK, so you feel like your head was on fire. What was it? I feel like stars are coming out of a volcano on the back of my head, and I felt it move, something was leaving, and then it all went well, and then it was over, and then it was funny. Okay, so it's kind of like what I asked you actually, if you had the impression that you had some kind of strange sensations in your body, including your head. Yes, we could say that either we have to choose: either what I felt was physical, or some kind of divine thing that came to take me away, take me, I don't know what. Are you taking something off? Who was trying to kill me so I could disappear somewhere, but not negative, positive. So you had the impression that they wanted to kill you? I feel like it was moving. I have a weird feeling. Did you feel it in your body? And then I was like, I'm going to go K.O., I'm going to die in the apples, and in total, it lasted, I don't know, 15-20 seconds and then it disappears. And that, you, that only happened to you once? Yes, only once in my life. And you felt worried, anxious? No, I was scared because I thought something was going to happen, but I was fine, and then nothing happened, it was 15 seconds or 30 seconds, I don't know. Okay, but when were you better than not better? Yes, and I can tell you something about it, I fell off my bike when I was fifteen, and I hurt myself here on my head, so it's a little weird. And suddenly, you thought it was a divine intervention? It's hard to say, that there was something mystical about it. Of mysticism? Yes, I found it. I felt like I was going to die and that it was all going to end for me. Then I was going somewhere. It's all right. I thought about it, I remember it very well, am I going to die or not, was it weird? It's all right. And those stars that I saw twinkling, just to say it, it's weird. Okay, I'm taking note, but did you think at that moment that you had a problem with your body? No, it is not. That your brain is liquefying...? I didn't have a boyfriend, but a person I knew well next to me. I don't know if there was a lady, I wasn't alone and that's where I saw this phenomenon that lasted between 15 and 30 seconds, I don't know, but I was leaving my place. I was leaving like a rocket, not a rocket, like a saucer. Then I thought it would go on, then I was going to die, plow. And then I didn't die and it didn't go on. Okay. You said it lasted, only a few seconds, right? It lasted a few seconds, but I felt funny, I thought I was going to die, but no pain and I was fine. Have you ever walked into a room and thought that people were talking about you and making fun of you, recently, in the last four weeks? No, not like that. Or have you seen things in magazines or on television that seemed to concern you as if the message was specifically for you? No, it is not. So, in the last four weeks, have you felt that you were controlled by an outside force, that you were an agent of God or an outside force, like an alien or a machine? No, it is not. That you were, for example, an agent of God or an outside force, like an alien or a machine, that you were forced to do things? No, it is not. Have you ever had the feeling, always during the last four weeks, that others could read your thoughts, that is, that your thoughts could be heard and known by others? Or have you ever heard your thoughts said out loud as if they were spoken outside your head, that they could be broadcast outside your head? No, it is not. Have you ever felt that an outside force was inside your head, thoughts? No, it is not. For example, you have an idea, a thought in your head, but you didn't think it? No, a bit like who would say a devils thought? For example, or something other than external forces. External forces? No, I have never had this problem. Have you ever felt or thought that your own ideas and thoughts were stolen by an outside force while taking things out of your head? You, how do you say... possessed by the demon? Not necessarily. In this case, for example, someone or something takes your thoughts away from you. You find yourself empty in your head without your thoughts? No, not at all. Another question: have you ever been made the remarks, remarks or do you think there is something strange in your presentation, in the way you dress, in the way you present yourself? I've never been remarked at, but I've probably often thought that I was being laughed at, but maybe because I wasn't like the others, but I've never been remarked at, to the extent that I'm saying to myself a little bit that escapes me today, that I don't know how to say... that I'm different from the others, help me. Are you different from others? Do you think you are different from others? Yes, sometimes and I think I have a slightly different attitude than others. In your personality? In my personality, yes. So, have you always been? I think Im a marginal. Okay, but have you ever thought that you are someone like that? I think I'm marginal, but how can I say... Okay. So sometimes, you may have a tendency to behave inappropriately in relation to society or to others, guided by yourself, by impulses that you can't control. For example, has it ever happened to you to do things that people consider strange or that have attracted the attention of others? For example, masturbating in public, urinating in public or having inappropriate behavior in front of others? No, no, on that side, I find myself totally normal. No, I've never had that obsession. In the last four weeks, have you ever tried to hurt someone or animals, that you have this urge, this urge that makes you rush to someone, to someone? No, it is not. Are there also things that you do and do over and over again, in a repetitive way, that you can't stop doing? For example, eating, putting things away, wanting to do the same things all the time, doing the same things without being able to stop. No, no, not a problem. If you can't do it or something interrupts you, you have to start all over again to be able to do things. No, Im not a maniac, either. I agree.\n"
