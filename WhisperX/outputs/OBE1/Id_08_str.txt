Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: I will detach you from the cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Set you free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: There's a point where you can take it out easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text:  Go for it, go for it, go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Okay, there's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: It's faster, you see, even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: So how was the second part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Did you like the second part or the first part more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: Yeah, I prefer this version of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text:  Like I had the feeling that I had like a third eye that opened and then I can see myself like I prefer this vision, this angle, this point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: And yeah, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: Well, I didn't see any remarkable differences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text:  but this one that I just told you about the point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: But yeah, I liked the experiment, I liked the meditation part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: It was great, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Did you feel a little bit like threatened, like scary when you get out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: Not scary, it was... It was surprising maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: It was surprising at first, then I got used to it really quickly and I enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text:  How was your feeling when you went out, when you went back to the physical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: When I went back, I was feeling really heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: Heavy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: Yeah, really heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: I was so much lighter when I was on top of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: The whole scene, I was feeling really heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: The weight of my body was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text:  yeah exactly so the feeling like out of the body is still somehow has a feeling like lighter yeah yeah absolutely yeah when you go back you feel like okay you have to go back to the healthiest yeah like much more in this second phase that in the first one then it was not I went like it's a it's a moving platform yeah it's moving yeah I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text:  I felt it, but not in the same way, not as highly as when I was out of my body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: I had a greater feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Okay, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Because, like, you go to lift, you go up and go out, and the other one you go really go out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Exactly, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: But I was not... After the meditation, the touching part, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text:  It was kind of hard for me to... I was feeling that it was my body, but I had the perfect vision of the delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: So it was not really convincing for me that it was not my body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text:  because of my awareness of the delay I was like sure it was my body and I was like even like it's knowing that I'm going to be touched in a place or that when I see it I'm actually getting touched for me it was kind of the same I was not like really disturbed by the fact that it was not touching me at the right places because I could just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text:  Compute with the delay that I'm going to be touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Text: So I just felt it in this approximately same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Text: Well perfect.
